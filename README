* Introduce
winspice provides windows remote desktop access using the Spice protocol.

* Building
** Prepare build environment

Use fedora 32 as the compilation platform

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ yum install yum-utils cmake mingw32-gtk3
$ yum-builddep mingw32-spice-glib
#+END_SRC

** Build spice server library

For convenience, use the stable tar package directly instead of the git version
to build spice library, e.g.

$ tar xf spice-{VERSION}.tar.bz2
$ cd spice-{VERSION}
$ mingw32-configure
$ mingw32-make
$ mingw32-make install

** Build winspice

$ git clone https://github.com/mathslinux/winspice.git
$ cd winspice
$ mkdir -p build && cd build && mingw32-cmake ../
$ mingw32-make

* How to run

Copy all the dll libraries that the winspice.exe depends on to the folder 
where the exe is located. Then open window cmd, run:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ winspice.exe
#+END_SRC
Or double click winspice.exe to run, the default port is 5900.

NOTE 1: winspice currently only supports windows 8 and above since windows DXGI
interface is used to get the display data.

In the future, a GUI window will be provided to set the port, username and 
other parameters.

NOTE 2: By default, the windows system does not have the icons required by gtk,
and it needs to be manually copied to the corresponding directory.

Copy the icons from: /usr/i686-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/share/icons
to path where winspice.exe is located. e.g.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
├── share
│   └── icons
│       └── Adwaita
└── winspice.exe
#+END_EXAMPLE
